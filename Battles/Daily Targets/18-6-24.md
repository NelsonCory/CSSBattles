## Thought Process

There are three components to this image - two rectangles of color 611B3F, and one rectangle of BE3184. The inner rectangle matches the color of the image background, it is possible that some additional code golfing could be performed with that in mind. The intuitive approach however is to place the left and rightmost rectangles together, and overlay an inner rectangle on top.


## Source Code
```
<div class="left-rect"></div>
<div class="right-rect"></div>
<div class="center-rect"></div>
<style>
  body {
    background: #BE3184;
    margin:0px;
  }
  .left-rect {
    width: 100px;
    height: 275px;
    background: #611B3F;
    transform: translate(100px, 100px)
  }
    .right-rect {
    width: 100px;
    height: 240px;
    background: #611B3F;
    transform: translate(200px,-315px)
  }
  .center-rect {
    width: 143px;
    height: 40px;
    background: #BE3184;
    transform: translate(125px,-385px)   
  }

</style>
```
