## Thought Process

The target could be broken down into a few key shapes: a central vertical rectangle, two circles, and a rectangle joining those two circles. This core structure is flanked by two vertical rectangles. 

The vertical rectangles were achieved by setting the Body tag's background to the desired color. From there, it was just a matter of assembling pieces in the center in layers. The balls are established within a single class, "purple-balls", which places a single purple ball in its position at the top of the image, then uses a box-shadow of the same color to produce the illusion of two seperate circles being on the screen. From there, a rectangle was moved to the center of the screen.

This solution involved heavy use of the translate transformation, which I believe resulted in an excessive number of characters being used. My performance in this daily is below average, using 190 characters more than the average. While my characters used could be reduced by eliminating whitespace, such a large gap implies an issue with my strategy. I will need to explore ways to reduce my characters used in the future.

## Source Code
```
<div class="central-rect"></div>
<div class="purple-balls"></div>
<div class="center-rod"></div>
<style>
  body{
    background-color: #81008F;
    margin: 0;
  }
  .central-rect{
    width: 150px;
    height: 300px;
    background: #DBBEDF;
    transform: translate(125px);
  }
  .purple-balls{
    width: 90px;
    height: 90px;
    background: #81008F;
    border-radius: 50%;
    transform: translate(155px,-270px);
    box-shadow: 0px 150px #81008F;
  }
  .center-rod {
    width: 30px;
    height: 100px;
    background: #81008F;
    transform: translate(185px, -280px);
  }
</style>
